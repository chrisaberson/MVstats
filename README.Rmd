To install the package, use the following code.


install.packages("devtools")  
install.packages"learnr")  
library(devtools)  
install_github("chrisaberson/MVstats")  

To run a tutorial, use this code. Currently, there is only a Logistic tutorial. 

library(learnr)  
run_tutorial("Logistic", package = "MVstats")  

After you run this code, the tutorial will open, either in a separate RStudio standalone window or in a tab on your browser. 

If this doesn't work, you likely need to update your rtools. Go to  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and download the most recent version (for your platform (Note: Rtools is just for Windows, I am looking into other platforms).
